# What is [MINICON](http://basetime.io/minicon)
[mini&bull;con](http://basetime.io/minicon) is a miniaturized developer conference, originating from [basetime](http://basetime.io) developer network, where community members vote on a theme, topics to discuss and provide challenges for contributors to work on. The catch is that all code must be licenesed opened source, and a working demo must be provided on CONference day. Full or porpotional rewards from contributors completing a challenge would be decided by the audience.

## Arranging your own minicon
Minicon is open sourced - you can use this format to host your own community event as long as you follow some basic guidelines. Your page should reference back to the official *minicon* website [basetime.io/minicon](http://basetime.io/minicon). Please read through and make sure you understand [the license](https://github.com/basetime/minicon/blob/master/LICENSE) before using the minicon name or logo in your event. Community events may not be of commercial nature; you may not charge entrance or participation fees for a Minicon, neither a direct fee or indirect as part of another event.
